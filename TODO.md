## Notes for Contributors

### API Design vs Spring Design Distinction
- **API Design** (`/api-design/`): Language-agnostic HTTP/REST principles only
- **Spring Design** (`/spring-design/`): Spring-specific implementation details
- New API design items should focus on protocol-level standards, not implementation

### Before Adding New Items
1. Check if the item fits into existing categories
2. Ensure it's not already covered in existing documents
3. Consider the business impact and priority
4. Add appropriate priority level (High/Medium/Low)
5. Determine if it belongs in API design (protocol) or Spring design (implementation)

### When Completing Items
1. Mark as complete with [x] and add ✅
2. Add completion date and contributor
3. Update related documents if needed
4. Consider if new items should be added based on learnings

### Review Schedule
- **Monthly**: Review high-priority items
- **Quarterly**: Review medium-priority items  
- **Annually**: Review low-priority and backlog items

## Recently Completed Major Features
- **Richardson Maturity Model** - Complete assessment framework for API maturity levels
- **Language-Agnostic API Design** - Removed all programming language references from API design
- **Comprehensive Testing Documentation** - Full testing pyramid coverage in Spring design
- **Modular Documentation Structure** - Examples, reference, and troubleshooting directories
