# Spring Boot Microservices Architecture Reference

This repository contains comprehensive guidelines and standards for building microservices using Spring Boot, with a focus on both imperative (Spring MVC) and reactive (Spring WebFlux) implementation approaches. The architecture follows Domain-Driven Design principles and provides detailed patterns for consistent implementation across services.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into three main sections:

### API Design

These documents outline standards for designing consistent and maintainable APIs across the microservice ecosystem.

- [API Version Strategy](api-design/API%20Version%20Strategy.md) - Guidelines for versioning APIs with URI-based patterns and deprecation policies
- [Documentation Requirements](api-design/Documentation%20Requirements.md) - Standards for OpenAPI specifications and example formats
- [Request Response Format](api-design/Request%20Response%20Format.md) - Consistent payload structures, error handling, and pagination patterns
- [Resource Naming and URL Structure](api-design/Resource%20Naming%20and%20URL%20Structure.md) - RESTful resource naming conventions and URL design principles
- [Reactive Patterns](api-design/Reactive%20Patterns.md) - Event-driven architecture, backpressure handling, and non-blocking interactions
- [Security Standards](api-design/Security%20Standards.md) - High-level approach to authentication, authorization, and API protection

### Spring Design

Implementation standards for Spring Boot applications, covering both imperative and reactive approaches.

- [Controller Implementation](spring-design/Controller%20Implementation%20(Reactive%20and%20Imperative).md) - Standards for implementing controllers with proper request/response handling
- [Dependency Injection and Component Management](spring-design/Dependency%20Injection%20and%20Component%20Management.md) - Best practices for DI and Spring component organization
- [Error Handling and Exception Management](spring-design/Error%20Handling%20and%20Exception%20Management.md) - Comprehensive exception handling patterns
- [Integration Testing Standards](spring-design/Integration%20Testing%20Standards.md) - Guidelines for integration testing approaches
- [Logging and Monitoring](spring-design/Logging%20and%20Monitoring.md) - Patterns for structured logging, metrics collection, and monitoring
- [Project Structure and Package Organization](spring-design/Project%20Structure%20and%20Package%20Organization.md) - Domain-centric package organization following DDD principles
- [Security Implementation](spring-design/Security%20Implementation) - Detailed security implementation with OAuth 2.0 and resource-based authorization
- [Spring Boot Configuration Best Practices](spring-design/Spring%20Boot%20Configuration%20Best%20Practices.md) - Standards for application configuration
- [Unit Testing Standards](spring-design/Unit%20Testing%20Standards.md) - Guidelines for effective unit testing
- [Contract Testing Standards](spring-design/Contract%20Testing%20Standards) - Standards for consumer-driven contract testing

## Getting Started

This repository serves as a reference guide for implementing microservices. To get started:

1. Review the [Project Structure and Package Organization](spring-design/Project%20Structure%20and%20Package%20Organization.md) document to understand the overall architecture
2. Explore the API design principles in the [Resource Naming and URL Structure](api-design/Resource%20Naming%20and%20URL%20Structure.md) document
3. Follow the implementation patterns in the [Controller Implementation](spring-design/Controller%20Implementation%20(Reactive%20and%20Imperative).md) document

## Key Architecture Principles

The architecture follows these core principles:

- **Domain-Driven Design**: Organizing code around business domains and bounded contexts
- **Hexagonal Architecture**: Separating domain logic from external concerns through ports and adapters
- **API-First Development**: Defining clear API contracts before implementation
- **Consistent Patterns**: Applying the same organizational and implementation patterns across services
- **Security by Design**: Implementing comprehensive security measures as a core requirement

## Technology Stack

- **Spring Boot**: Core framework for both imperative and reactive services
- **Spring WebFlux**: For reactive programming model
- **Spring Security**: For OAuth 2.0 implementation and resource-based security
- **Micrometer**: For metrics collection and monitoring
- **OpenAPI 3.0**: For API documentation
- **Spring Cloud Contract**: For consumer-driven contract testing

## Testing Approach

The architecture emphasizes comprehensive testing at multiple levels:

- **Unit Testing**: For testing components in isolation
- **Integration Testing**: For testing interactions between components
- **Contract Testing**: For verifying service interactions according to contracts
- **Security Testing**: For validating security implementations
