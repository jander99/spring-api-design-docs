# Advanced API Patterns

## Overview

This directory contains advanced architectural patterns and specialized techniques for building sophisticated, scalable APIs. These patterns support event-driven architectures, streaming protocols, reactive programming, and complex data flow scenarios.

## Files

### [Event-Driven-Architecture.md](Event-Driven-Architecture.md)
Comprehensive guide to event-driven architecture patterns for building reactive APIs. Covers event types, routing strategies, caching mechanisms, and patterns for scalable, loosely-coupled systems with asynchronous processing.

### [HTTP-Streaming-Patterns.md](HTTP-Streaming-Patterns.md)
Detailed patterns for implementing HTTP streaming protocols in APIs. Includes Server-Sent Events (SSE), WebSockets, and HTTP/2 streaming techniques for real-time data delivery.

### [Streaming-Documentation-Patterns.md](Streaming-Documentation-Patterns.md)
Specialized documentation patterns for streaming APIs and real-time data flows. Covers how to document asynchronous operations, event schemas, and streaming protocols.

### [Reactive-Error-Handling.md](Reactive-Error-Handling.md)
Advanced error handling patterns for reactive and streaming APIs. Includes strategies for managing errors in asynchronous operations, stream failures, and distributed system fault tolerance.
