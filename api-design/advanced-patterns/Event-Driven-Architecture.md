# Event-Driven Architecture

## Overview

Event-driven architecture enables building systems that react to events as they happen. Events represent important business occurrences (like "order created" or "payment processed") that other parts of your system need to know about.

## What is Event-Driven Architecture?

Instead of services calling each other directly, they communicate by:
- Publishing events when something important happens
- Subscribing to events they care about
- Processing events asynchronously

This creates loosely-coupled systems that are easier to scale and maintain.

## Key Concepts

### Event Types
1. **Domain Events**: Business occurrences (order.created, payment.processed)
2. **Integration Events**: Service-to-service communication
3. **Command Events**: Instructions to perform actions

### Event Structure
All events follow a standard format:
```json
{
  "id": "evt-12345",
  "type": "order.created",
  "timestamp": "2024-07-15T14:32:22Z",
  "source": "order-service",
  "data": { /* event-specific data */ }
}
```

## Essential Patterns

### 1. Event Sourcing
Store all changes as events instead of current state:
- Events become the source of truth
- Can rebuild state by replaying events
- Provides complete audit trail

### 2. CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
Separate read and write operations:
- Commands: Change data (create, update, delete)
- Queries: Read data (get, search, list)
- Allows independent scaling and optimization

### 3. Saga Pattern
Manage complex business processes across multiple services:
- Break long transactions into steps
- Each step publishes events
- Handle failures with compensation

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Design Your Events
1. Identify business events in your domain
2. Define event schema with required fields
3. Choose event naming conventions
4. Plan for schema evolution

### Step 2: Set Up Event Infrastructure
1. Choose event broker (Kafka, RabbitMQ, etc.)
2. Configure event publishing
3. Set up event subscriptions
4. Implement event storage

### Step 3: Implement Event Handlers
1. Create event publishers
2. Build event consumers
3. Add error handling and retries
4. Ensure idempotent processing

### Step 4: Add Monitoring
1. Track event processing metrics
2. Monitor event flow health
3. Set up alerting for failures
4. Log event processing for debugging

## Common Use Cases

- **Order Processing**: Handle complex order workflows
- **User Notifications**: Send messages based on user actions
- **Data Synchronization**: Keep multiple systems in sync
- **Audit Logging**: Track all system changes
- **Real-time Analytics**: Process events for insights

## Best Practices

1. **Keep events simple**: Include only necessary data
2. **Make processing idempotent**: Handle duplicate events gracefully
3. **Plan for failures**: Implement retries and dead letter queues
4. **Version your events**: Support schema evolution
5. **Monitor everything**: Track event flow and processing health
