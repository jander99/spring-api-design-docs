# Security Standards

## Overview

Security is a fundamental aspect of API design that must be implemented consistently across all microservices. This document outlines our high-level approach to authentication, authorization, and API protection.

## Authentication

### OAuth 2.0 Implementation

All microservices must implement our custom OAuth 2.0 authentication mechanism with the following specifications:

#### Token Validation

1. **JWT Format**: Authentication tokens use the JWT (JSON Web Token) format
2. **Token Validation**: Services must validate:
   - Token signature
   - Expiration time
   - Issuer claim

#### Token Types

| Token Type | Use Case | Lifetime |
|------------|----------|----------|
| Access Token | API access authorization | Short-lived (1 hour max) |
| Refresh Token | Obtaining new access tokens | Medium-lived (24 hours - 30 days) |

#### Public Paths

Each microservice must maintain a list of public paths that don't require authentication:
- Actuator health endpoints
- OpenAPI documentation endpoints
- Other publicly accessible resources

### Authentication Headers

Use standard Authorization header format:
```
Authorization: Bearer {token}
```

## Authorization

### Resource-Based Authorization

Our authorization model is resource-based rather than role or scope-based:

1. **Binary Authorization**: A user either has access to a resource or doesn't
2. **Authentication vs. Authorization**: Users can be authenticated (valid token) but not authorized for specific resources

### Token Refresh

Implement proactive token refresh several minutes before expiration to maintain session continuity.

## API Protection

### Security Headers

Implement these security headers in all API responses:

| Header | Value | Purpose |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Content-Security-Policy | appropriate values | Prevents XSS attacks |
| X-Content-Type-Options | nosniff | Prevents MIME type sniffing |
| Cache-Control | no-store | Prevents sensitive data caching |
| X-XSS-Protection | 1; mode=block | Additional XSS protection |

### CORS Configuration

For APIs that support browser clients:

1. **Specific Origins**: Explicitly list allowed origins, avoid wildcards
2. **Credentials**: Control whether credentials can be included
3. **Methods & Headers**: Only expose necessary methods and headers

### Rate Limiting and Throttling

Rate limiting and throttling are handled at the infrastructure level (nginx/traefik) rather than in individual microservices.

## Security Considerations for Reactive APIs

### Streaming Authentication

For long-lived streaming connections:

1. **Token Refreshing**: Leverage existing token refresh mechanism during active streams
2. **Connection Termination**: Handle authentication failures during streaming

### Non-blocking Security Checks

Implement security checks in a non-blocking manner for reactive services.

## Security Logging and Monitoring

### Audit Logging Requirements

Log the following security events:

1. Authentication failures
2. Authorization failures
3. Access to sensitive resources

### Security Event Format

Security events should include:
- Timestamp
- Event type
- User identifier (when available)
- Resource path
- Reason for failure
- Request ID for correlation

This security standards document provides a high-level foundation for consistent security implementation across all microservices in our ecosystem. More detailed implementation guidance will be provided in the Spring Boot patterns document.
