# Flow Control and Backpressure

## Client Capabilities

### Signaling Flow Control
Document how clients can signal flow control capabilities:

```http
GET /v1/orders/stream HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/x-ndjson
Prefer: respond-async
X-Stream-Buffer-Size: 100
X-Stream-Rate-Limit: 10/second
```

### Server Response Headers
Include flow control information in response headers:

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/x-ndjson
X-Stream-Rate: 10/second
X-Stream-Buffer-Size: 100
X-Stream-Total-Items: 10000
```

## Backpressure Handling

### When Clients Can't Keep Up
When clients can't keep up with the stream:

1. **Buffer limits**: Define maximum buffer sizes
2. **Rate limiting**: Implement configurable rate limits
3. **Client feedback**: Allow clients to signal processing delays
4. **Circuit breakers**: Implement circuit breakers for failing clients

### Rate Limiting Implementation
```http
HTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests
Content-Type: application/json
Retry-After: 5

{
  "type": "https://example.com/problems/rate-limit",
  "title": "Rate Limit Exceeded",
  "status": 429,
  "detail": "Stream rate limit of 10/second exceeded",
  "retryAfter": 5
}
```

## Monitoring and Metrics

### Key Metrics to Track
- **Stream duration**: How long streams remain active
- **Throughput**: Records per second
- **Error rates**: Percentage of failed records
- **Client disconnections**: Frequency of client drops
- **Buffer utilization**: Memory and queue usage

### Health Checks
```http
GET /v1/health/streaming HTTP/1.1

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "status": "healthy",
  "activeStreams": 45,
  "averageThroughput": "150/second",
  "bufferUtilization": "23%",
  "errorRate": "0.1%"
}
```

## Framework Implementation

### Different Framework Support
- **Express.js**: Use Response.write() for manual streaming
- **FastAPI**: StreamingResponse with generators
- **Django**: StreamingHttpResponse for chunked responses
- **Spring Boot**: See spring-design documentation for WebFlux reactive streams

### Connection Management
1. **Connection pooling**: Manage database connections efficiently
2. **Timeout handling**: Implement appropriate timeouts
3. **Resource cleanup**: Clean up resources on client disconnect
4. **Graceful shutdown**: Handle server shutdown gracefully
