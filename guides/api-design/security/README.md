## Why Security Matters

Every API needs protection. Without good security, unauthorized users can access your data, steal information, or harm your system. This guide helps you build secure APIs from the start.

## Overview

This directory shows you how to protect your APIs. You'll learn how to verify who users are and what they can do. These guidelines work for all types of API projects.

## What You'll Learn

We cover three main areas:
- **Who can use your API** (authentication)
- **What users can do** (authorization)  
- **How to block attacks** (protection)

All security patterns in this guide follow current best practices. They help you build security into your API design from day one.

## Files

### [Security Standards.md](security-standards.md)
This file shows you how to secure your API. You'll learn about OAuth 2.1 and OpenID Connect. These are industry standards for login and access control.

The guide covers:
- How users prove their identity
- How to control what users can access
- Ways to protect against common attacks
- Managing user sessions and tokens
- Setting security headers on HTTP responses
